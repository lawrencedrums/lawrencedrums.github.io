# CS50x Final Project - Sorting Visualizer
### OVERVIEW
A sorting algorithm is a process that puts elements of a list in a certain order. It was first introduced by David in CS50x at week 2. At the end of that lecture, we were shown a video of sorting algorithms in action, comparing the processing speed of different algorithms. I'm deeply fascinated by the ability to create and animate graphics from just typing words in a programming language. Since then I got really interested in implementing a sorting visualizer of my own. The final project seems like a perfect opportunity to make that into a reality.
### GOALS
 - Create a sorting visualizer webapp using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
 - Learn and practise using the above-mentioned languages.
 - Solidify understanding of sorting algorithms of different efficiency.
 - Familiarise with version control via GitHub.
### MILESTONES
Version 1: 2 to 3 algorithms
 - Create a simple visualizer with 2 to 3 working algorithms. Basic, simple and effective styling. 

Version 2: More algorithms, mobile version
 - Implement 2 to 3 more algorithms. Include mobile-friendly site design.

Version 3: Refine styling, add options
 - Finalize webapp styling including color options. Add a menu for options like sorting speed, array size, etc.
